<div> <p> Hello Inigo!
I was supposed to give this letter to you
during the christmas party last wednesday
but i chickened out and got scared </p>  </div>
<div> I hope you take time on reading this since I really want you to know how I truly feel </div>
<div> I know you're probably weirded out by those messages I sent you last November </div>
<div> That was an informal way of me voicing out my feelings for you and I'm very sorry for that</div>
<div> You probably thought that was a joke or something but through this I will be able to say what I truly feel about you </div>
<div> I already know that you don't like me back and that's fine </div>
<div> But I always get butterflies in my stomach whenever I see you or you reply to me </div>
<div> I am not expecting something in return since I already know how you feel about me but it would make me really happy even if you just read this </div>
<div> Gusto kita, I want to be there for you always through your ups and downs, I will support you with every decision you make (kahit i-block mo pa 'ko HAHAHAHA)  </div>
<div> It's okay if you have to reject me since alam ko namang top student ka and it's okay if you don't have the same feelings for me kasi sabi nga nila not everyone has the chance to get what they want </div>
<div> I don't really express my feelings for someone like this but you are the only exception </div>
<div> That's all, I hope you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! </div>
<div> - Jiroh <3 </div>
